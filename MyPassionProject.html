		<p> I am passionate about learning about the world. <span class="whitetext">My goal is to remember the names, the capital cities, the leaders, and the national language(s) of all of the countries. </span> I am also passionate about staying updated on what is happening in other parts of the world and I enjoy spending my time reading the top stories in newspapers and magazines. </p>

        <p> I am currently living and studying in New York City. <span class="whitetext">I was born in Singapore but my parents are from Nepal. </span>I enjoy eating good food (desserts!) and I crave for an adventure. <span class="whitetext">Peace! </span></p>
